#### Thoughts:
Since I've finished the responsive web design course from freeCodeCamp, I was planning on doing the odin project but I decided I wouldn't do it for the 100 days of code challenge as I want to go at it on my own pace. Plus, I wanted to do some C# exercises, then make an application using winforms.
