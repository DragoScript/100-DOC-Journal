# Day 85: July 17, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- Created ShinyHunter project in Android Studio
- Started Designing a Prototype app on Adobe XD

#### Thoughts:
I decide to use API 30 for the minimum SDK, because the Google Play store's [API level requirement](https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk) is API 30 or above. Also I realize that I should probably design a prototype of the app using Adobe XD before making the actual app, that way I don't have to design it as I'm making it in Android Studio
