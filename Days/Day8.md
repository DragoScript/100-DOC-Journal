#### Thoughts:
In the Learn Java course, I did the final three topics; inheritance, debugging, and  2D Arrays (which gave me the most trouble) and finished the course. For the responsive web design course, I learned that I can create a custom CSS variable, for example, `--cool-color: green;` and give that variable to the background keyword, which will make the background green. Additionally, I learned about the overwrite hierarchy in CSS and made a triangle diagram of it:
