# Day 83: July 15, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- Spent 1 hour trying to fix the error from the final challenge from the YouTube video called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) by freeCodeCamp

#### Thoughts:
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find a solution to my problem online, I tried searching "kotlin error PID: 19851" no results for that, I tired "kotlin java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to instantiate activity ComponentInfo" there was one result, though the solution didn't work. I this is one of the issues with trying to translate Java code to Kotlin, Had I done this in Java probably wouldn't be facing this issue right now, well guess I'm going to start working on my android app project called "ShinyHunter" the next day.
