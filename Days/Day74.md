# Day 74: July 6, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 8:00:58 and stopped at 9:00:58
- I read the Android Developer Documentation: [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide) section (App resources/Resource types/Layout part  to App resources/Resource types/String part)

#### Thoughts:
The eighth hour of the video is mostly about the XML files, and the last 18 minutes was about [material](https://material.io/) design.
