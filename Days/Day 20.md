#### Today's Progress:
- Spent 2 hours working on the CSS part of the Survey Form and completed it.<br>

- My Survey Form passed [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)'s code grader script<br>

#### Thoughts:
Now that I finished my survey form web page, I don't think it's as good as the one from freeCodeCamp's example survey form, But I think its good enough for now.
