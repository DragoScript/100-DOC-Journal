# Day 51: June 13, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- I watched a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/n5WneLo6vOY) about winforms, and I spend 1 hour creating a winform application called WinCounter.<br>

#### Thoughts:
WinCounter is very similar to my Java application called GUI.java from Day 1. The biggest difference is that I added a reset button to reset the counter. My only issue with my WinCounter application, is that I can't get the number to stay center. Maybe I missed a center text setting in the label property.
