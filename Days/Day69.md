# Day 69: July 01, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 3:06:00 and stopped at 4:06:00
- I read the Android Developer Documentation: [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide) section (App resources/Localization/Unicode and internationalization support part to App resources/Localization/Language and locale resolution overview part)

#### Thoughts:
The fourth hour, was about Java concepts as usually, I decided to skip the challenge since it's not an Android app and I don't feel like doing another Terminal based application.
