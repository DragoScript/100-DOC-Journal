# Day 68: June 30, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 2:16:00 and stopped at 3:06:00
- I read the Android Developer Documentation: [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide) section (App resources/Localization/Localize your app part to App resources/Localization/Test your app with pseudolocales part)

#### Thoughts:
The third hour of the video is mostly dedicated to Java concepts that i already know and there was no challenge.

###### Link(s) to work:
