# Day 82: July 14, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- Spent 40 minutes doing the final challenge from the YouTube video called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) by freeCodeCamp
- Stuck due to a "Fatal Exception" error I'm unable to solve (code can be found in "Link(s) to work:")<br>

#### Thoughts:
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the final challenge to work thanks to an annoying "Fatal Exception" error I encountered. I don't know if I'm able to solve this issue since I don't understand the error message. If I'm unable to get it fixed the next day, then I'm calling the final challenge a failure and I will move on to my android app project that I want to get done before the 100th day.
