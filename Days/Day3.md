# Day 3: April 26, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- Tried to create a GUI application using [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/index.html) which is more modern than swing. Problem is, its no longer included with the standard install of Java. I tried to install it but it was too much work so I gave up on It.


#### Thoughts:
I was planning to use JavaFX to build the GUI for the calculator app. But since I'm having difficulties trying to install it, I'm going to stick with swing. The calculator app is going to look outdated but if it works it works.
