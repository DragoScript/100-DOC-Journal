# Day 32: May 25, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- I spent 2 hours finishing the Portfolio Web Page and completed it<br>

- My Portfolio Web Page passed [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)'s code grader script<br>

#### Thoughts:
Now that I've finished the final project that means I've completed freeCodeCamp's responsive web design course... Well, unfortunately for me by the time I was working on the 3rd project, the course was overhauled. This means my progress had been rested, oh well, at least I'll have the opportunity to redo some since [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) may make me do some exercises on freeCodeCamp.
