# Day 77: July 9, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 10:37:50 and stopped at 10:40:36
- Spent 30 minutes doing the final challenge from the YouTube video

#### Thoughts:
I'm almost done with the UI for the final challenge, I just have to figure out how to get text input from the right (the emulator) to the left (the design view).
