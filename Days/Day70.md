# Day 70: July 02, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 4:06:00 and stopped at 4:56:00
- I read the Android Developer Documentation: [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide) section (App resources/Inline complex XML resources part)

#### Thoughts:
Today was a very busy day for me, I was only able to watch 1 hour of the youtube video and read the documentation, so I didn't have time to do the challenge that was on the video.
