# Day 5: April 28, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- Created a calculator application in Java called JaCalc using what I learned from [Day 3](../Days/Day3.md) when creating the [ButtonAdd](../Attachments-DOC/ButtonAdd.java) application.

#### Thoughts:
JaCalc is going to be the final Java desktop application I create for the 100 Days of Code challenge. However, I will continue to progress further in the Learn Java course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java). In addition, I am going to try my hand at a new project. That project will be Portfolio website. But before I do that I need to sharpen my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.
