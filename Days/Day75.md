# Day 75: July 7, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 9:00:58 and stopped at 10:03:50
- I read the Android Developer Documentation: [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide) section (App resources/Resource types/Style part to App resources/Resource types/More Types part)

#### Thoughts:
The ninth hour of the YouTube video, the first 16 minutes was about SnackBar & CardView, and the rest was about RecyclerView.
