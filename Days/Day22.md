#### Today's Progress:
- Spent 3 hours working on the CSS part of the Product Landing Page and completed it.<br>

- My Survey Form passed [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)'s code grader script<br>

#### Thoughts:
It took me a while to do the CSS part of the project and I had to rely on the CSS from freeCodeCamp's example product landing page to be able to complete mine. Man, these web developers on YouTube make it look easy, I wonder how long it took them to master it?
