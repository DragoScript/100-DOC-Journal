# Day 65: June 27, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
-  First time setting up Android Studio on Fedora Linux
-  Read the Android Developer Documentation: [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide) section
-  Created a test app to get the hang of Android Studio

#### Thoughts:
Before I can start to make Android apps, I need to spend time learning how to use Android Studio and all of its features as well as reading the documentation or watching YouTube tutorial videos.
