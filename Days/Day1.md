-  Watched a 13min [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/5o3fMLPY7qY) on how to create a GUI in Java, using the [swing API](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-swing)
-  Replicated the GUI program from the tutorial

#### Thoughts: 
I'll have to continue learning more about making GUI application with Java before creating a application that uses the GUI.
I'm still thinking of programming project to do in Java. 
This is what I came up with so far:
- Bug Tracker
- Calculator
