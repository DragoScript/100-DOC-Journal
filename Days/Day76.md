# Day 76: July 8, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 10:38:31 and stopped at 10:37:50


#### Thoughts:
The first 20 minutes of the YouTube was wrapping up on RecyclerView, the next 17 minutes was about Fonts, I will start doing the challenge the next day. I decide to stop reading the Android Studio documentation, because I think it would be better If I used the documentation as a guide when I get stuck creating my mobile app.
