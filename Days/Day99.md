# Day 99: July 31, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- Spent 5 hours working on ShinyHunter backend

#### Thoughts:
I know I'm not going to be able to finish my app in time but hopefully I can at least get it to at least create a shiny hunt, add or minus the counter, although once the user fully quits the app it won't save the changes made by the user.
