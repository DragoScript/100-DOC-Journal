# Day 71: July 03, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 4:56:00 and stopped at 5:39:00
- I read the Android Developer Documentation: [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide) section (App resources/Resource types/Overview part)

#### Thoughts:
The Java part of the YouTube video should be done, and the next half of the video should be dedicated to Android Studio.

###### Link(s) to work:
