# Day 73: July 5, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- continued watching the YouTube video by freeCodeCamp called [Android Development for Beginners](https://youtu.be/fis26HvvDII) at 6:58:42 and stopped at 8:00:58
- I read the Android Developer Documentation: [App Basics](https://developer.android.com/guide) section (App resources/Resource types/Color state list to App resources/Resource types/Drawable part)


#### Thoughts:
The seventh hour of the YouTube video, majority of the time was dedicated to  coding Layouts similar to what you do with HTML and CSS. Although, I'm going to try to stick to using the design mode feature in Android Studio to create layouts since it's faster.
