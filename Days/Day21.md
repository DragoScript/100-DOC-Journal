# Day 21: May 14, 2022
#### Today's Progress:
- Started Working on the third project called, Product Landing Page by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/)'s responsive web design course. 
-  Spent 1 hour and 30 minutes working on the HTML part of the Product Landing Page and finished it.<br>

#### Thoughts:
Now that I finished the HTML part all that's left is the CSS part of the project.
